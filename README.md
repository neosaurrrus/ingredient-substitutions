Welcome to SubsChef, an app to record ingredients that can be swapped for other ingredients. Great if you don't have a certain recipe

Built with Rails.

## Installation
Clone down this repo. Run bundler install to grab all the required dependancies. Run `rails db:migrate` to build the relevent databases and `rail s` to run it locally.

## Usage
The App will allow you to signup as a new user, login and logout. Once you are signed in, you can create a new Attraction, specifying its name, location, comments, and whever you have been there before. All users can view all attractions but you need to have created an attraction to then be able to edit or delete it.
